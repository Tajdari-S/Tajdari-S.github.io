I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer and Cyber Sciences at Augusta University. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Princeton University, working with [Prof. H. Vincent Poor](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/h-vincent-poor) and [Prof. Sanjeev Kulkarni](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/sanjeev-r-kulkarni); I also collaborated with [Prof. Vahid Tarokh](https://people.duke.edu/~vt45/) (Duke) and [Prof. Taposh Banerjee](https://sites.google.com/view/taposhbanerjee/home) (University of Pittsburgh). I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical and Systems Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania under [Prof. Hamed Hassani](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~hassani/) and worked closely with [Prof. George J. Pappas](https://www.georgejpappas.org/), [Prof. Aritra Mitra](https://amitra2.wordpress.ncsu.edu/) (NC State), and [Prof. Aryan Mokhtari](https://sites.utexas.edu/mokhtari/) (UT Austin).

## Research

I work on the theoretical foundations of AI, aiming to design scalable and reliable learning algorithms for nonstationary, distributed, and adversarial environments.

- **Generative AI & Diffusion Models.** I study score-based diffusion, normalizing flows, and energy-based models, with theory for sample efficiency, stability, and control of memorization, as well as principled estimators via score matching.

- **Multimodal Machine Learning.** I develop representation learning and fusion methods for heterogeneous data (vision, audio, text, and time series), with guarantees for alignment, robustness, and sequential decision-making across modalities.

- **Reinforcement Learning (federated & asynchronous).** I analyze and design RL algorithms under delayed, partial, or adversarial updates, providing non-asymptotic guarantees for reliability in distributed systems.

- **Distributed Learning & Minimax Optimization.** I build communication- and computation-efficient methods for convex and nonconvex minimax problems, including robustness to delays and Byzantine agents.

- **Change Detection under Uncertainty.** I develop detectors for high-dimensional and unnormalized distributions (e.g., energy-based models) that adapt to nonstationarity with provable false-alarm and detection-delay guarantees.

- **Submodular Optimization & Meta-Learning.** I create scalable algorithms for discrete decision-making and adaptive meta-learning, enabling near-optimal performance in large-scale, uncertain settings.

- **Adversarial Robustness & Decision-Making under Uncertainty.** I study principled risk measures and worst-case analyses to ensure dependable behavior under distribution shift and adversarial perturbations.

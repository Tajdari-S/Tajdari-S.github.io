I am a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University, where I work with [Prof. H. Vincent Poor](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/h-vincent-poor) and [Prof. Sanjeev Kulkarni](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/sanjeev-r-kulkarni). Previously, I completed my PhD at the University of Pennsylvania under the guidance of [Prof. Hamed Hassani](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~hassani/). Prior to that, I earned degrees in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Mathematics from the Isfahan University of Technology.
My research interests lie in statistics, optimization, and machine learning. More specifically, I focus on change detection, submodular optimization, federated learning, and reinforcement learning.
